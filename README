ZzzFS: dataset management Ã  la ZFS

ZzzFS ("snooze FS") brings a set of ZFS management commands to non-ZFS volumes,
turning any directory on a traditional filesystem into a zpool-like object.
Using only the Python standard library, ZzzFS can be useful to, for example,
test tools that use ZFS functionality on a system lacking real ZFS. Of course,
ZzzFS misses all of the low-level features underpinning true ZFS volumes:
checksumming, copy-on-write, etc.


This is a functional work in progress; don't trust any important data to it
just yet. The test suite covers the following features:

 - create/destroy "filesystems"
 - create/destroy, clone/promote, send/receive, diff snapshots
 - get/set/inherit attributes


Example usage:

  $ zzzpool create pool /tmp/pool
  $ zzzpool list
  NAME    SIZE    ALLOC   FREE    CAP     HEALTH  ALTROOT
  pool       -        -      -      -     ONLINE  -
  $ zzzfs create pool/work
  $ zzzfs create pool/play
  $ zzzfs snapshot pool/work@yesterday
  $ zzzfs list -t all
  NAME                    USED    AVAIL   REFER   MOUNTPOINT
  pool                       -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/pool
  pool/play                  -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/pool/play
  pool/work                  -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/pool/work
  pool/work@yesterday        -        -       -   -
  $ zzzfs send pool/work@yesterday | zzzfs receive pool/more_work

it's only appropriate to pair "snooze" with "cuddle."
